### *** [Go to App](https://eatmorefood.herokuapp.com) ***

For this project, I am creating an app to help me with my goal to gain weight/muscle. There are three pillars that are crucial when it comes to exercising: 1) The actual workout itself. 2) Getting adequate sleep/rest. 3) Your food intake. This app will help with the last pillar. Whether you are trying to lose weight or gain weight, it is crucial to have a proper diet. 

This app will ask the user for a caloric goal for the day. You will then be able to submit a food that you have just eaten 
and watch the progress bar fill up. This app is meant to have a very minimalistic design.

**Basic Functionality**
- User will see a progress bar representing total calories eaten for that day.
- User will be able to search for popular foods using [Nutritionix' API](https://www.nutritionix.com/)
- User will be able to input their own favorite custom foods.
- User will be able to see the progress bar fill up as they submit foods eaten.


### Technologies Used
FRONT END: 
- HTML
- CSS/SASS (Compass? for svg gooey menu)

BACK END:

- Passport.js for Authentication/Authorization
- Express.js for Web Server/Routing
- MongoDB/Mongoose for Data Storage
- Heroku for Deployment

### Biggest Obstacles
